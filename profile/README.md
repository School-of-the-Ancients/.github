📘 Project Summary

School of the Ancients VR is an AI-powered, immersive learning platform where students engage with history’s greatest thinkers, scientists, and leaders inside a dynamic VR classroom.

The system fuses three layers:

Autonomous AI Company – a self-managing AI “faculty” that designs, adapts, and evaluates the curriculum.

School of the Ancients VR – immersive domains where learners meet AI-emulated historical figures who teach in their own voices and styles.

Matrix Operator – the orchestration layer that spawns environments, assets, and NPCs on command (“Operator, load the Renaissance”).

Core innovation: Socratic Q&A is woven into the experience, so learning becomes a dialogue, not a download. Instead of reading about Galileo, Cleopatra, or Marcus Aurelius, students debate, experiment, and reflect with them inside living worlds.
